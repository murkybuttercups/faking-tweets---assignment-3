# Fake Tweets Project Description

So often while browsing social media, users tend to wonder if they trust their fidelity of their content, and wonder how they can sift through all of the #fakenews. Nowadays with all of the software availiable to us and Twitter becoming a viable source of information, it is easier than ever to fake a tweet. Worry not dear shutins, because this tweet generator just adds to the problem! Fake Tweets by Jason Ranaghan was created to well, create fake tweets. This project aims to poke fun at the absurdity of modern digital communications, and utlizes the Twitter Developer API to do it!

Fake Tweets features four great fake profiles: Donald Trump, Ariana Grande, J.K. Rowling, and Wendy's and limitless possibilities. Popular tweets are randomly generated, so you never know what you're going to get! This site employs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX & JSON, and PHP. When creating this project, much thought went into accurately recreating Twitter's tweet template and special attention was paid when working with CSS.
